# Web Development Project 4 - *Harvard Art Museum Random Artwork*

Submitted by: **Ashley Oliveira Andrade**

This web app: **lets users find new random art pieces and if they already know a piece, they can ban the atribute that makes it known.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - [x] To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!
