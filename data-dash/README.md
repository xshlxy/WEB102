# Web Development Project 5 - *Recipe Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Ashley Oliveira Andrade**

This web app: **shows some fetched recipes using Spoonacular API, it gives some stats, and in the future it will be able to do even more.**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [x] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [x] *Total Recipes*
  - [x] *Favorite Recipes*
  - [x] *Recipes Today*
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [ ] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

This project was pretty hard, I had some issues with figuring out the different APIs and I wasn''t able to complete it fully, like the filter part of it. I am happy that I am becoming more and more familiar with fetching data with APIs.
